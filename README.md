# econres

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `econres` is to facilitate *my* economics research by
helping me to load `R` packages *I* commonly use, create descriptive
plots and table presentations of time series (based on *my* aesthetic
taste), and automate other tasks common for *my* economic research.

If someone else finds `econres` useful for *their* research they are
free to use it (or parts of it) as they please.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `econres` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lyuben-ivanov/econres")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## library(econres)
## basic example code
```
